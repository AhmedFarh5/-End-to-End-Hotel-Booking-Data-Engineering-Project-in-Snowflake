# Snowflake-Native Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a hands-on implementation of an end-to-end data engineering pipeline built entirely inside Snowflake.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to transform raw hotel booking data into clean, analytics-ready datasets using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold).

## Architecture
- Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion using Snowflake Stages & COPY INTO
- Silver Layer: Data cleaning, validation, and transformation
- Gold Layer: Analytics-ready tables and aggregations

## Tech Stack
- Snowflake
- Snowflake SQL
- Snowsight Dashboards
- File Formats & Stages
- Medallion Architecture

## Key Learnings
- Handling real-world data quality issues
- Designing ELT pipelines in Snowflake
- Writing production-style SQL transformations
- Building dashboards directly in Snowflake

## Credits
This project was implemented as a hands-on learning exercise inspired by a Snowflake data engineering tutorial by Jayachandra Kadiveti.
